# Ibvs_controller: ROS2 package for simulation Image-Based Visual-servo control in Gazebo.
This repository contains ROS2 package that I made for my master degree's thesis and thesis itself. This package implements IBVS with ORB and AKAZE keypoints. For extra information read slides with notes or full text of dissertation.
# Branches
ros1_2 branch contain some modification for simulation part. More certainly motors with effort controller by ROS1. \
Pi branch contain code for RaspberryPi that wasn't tested due COVID.
